# GUnit Overview
Lightweight unit testing framework built to fill the missing unit testing functionality I needed for Godot C# Scripts. Should behave very similarly to NUnit, the one key difference being this framework will not go searching the assembly for tests. 

It could by walking referenced assemblies and looking for tests using reflection, I just have no need for that level of automation.
