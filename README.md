# GUnit Overview
Lightweight unit testing framework built to fill the missing unit testing functionality I needed for Godot's C# Scripts. Wraps the NUnit Framework's "Assert" class and behaves in a similar way other than needing explicit registering of tests to be run.

It could be automated to walk referenced assemblies and look for tests using reflection, but I have no need for that level of automation at this time.
